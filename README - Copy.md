# DESCRIPTION

This initiative aims to enhance the model under ERST’s Integrated Risk and Capital Stress Testing (IST) framework specific to forecasting possible additional operational losses during a pandemic scenario using internal Bank data.

# Research Questions
1. Which macroeconomic factors are associated with the increased/decreased risk in the Bank’s internal operational losses?
2. What is the performance of a predictive model in assessing the Bank’s operational losses?
3. What are the projected losses for the next 5 years given a severe but plausible macroeconomic scenario? Provide forecasts for material internal risk categories.

# Contents
1. Data folder -  contains Models, Risk Categories, and Summary data

2. Plots folder - contains plots of EDA, and forecast plots

3. Predicted Values folder - contains the predicted values for each risk category

4. Updated Data folder - results of Data Cleaning (this data is used for the R files and modelling proper)
